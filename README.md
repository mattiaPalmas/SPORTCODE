**Version 1.0**

___

**Overview**

This app's about sports. It happened to me that I was watching a sport that I didn't know the rules.
So I decided to build a quick app that you can click on a sport in the list and rapidly understand the main concept of the game.

**How it works**

Step 1: Select the sport icon that you would like to know more.

Step 2: You will be taken to the next activity where there is a menu with the basic concept of the game.
